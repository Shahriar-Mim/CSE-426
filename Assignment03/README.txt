Question of Assignment 03.(FALL2021)
<<<Ford Fulkerson Algorithm>>>
Given a weighted directed graph and a list of source vertices and a list of sink vertices. There can be anti-parallel edges as well. 
1. If the graph has multiple sources and sinks, then add a super-source and a super-sink. 2 points.
2. If the graph has anti-parallel edges, then remove those edges by adding a dummy vertex. 2 points.
3. Find the value of the maximum flow in this flow network using the Ford Fulkerson algorithm. 4 points.
3. From the Ford Fulkerson algorithm, find the minimum cut  (S,T)  and show the vertices in set S and the vertices in set T. 2 points.

You can use C/C++/JAVA/Python to perform the above actions. Manage the input-output format as you think is necessary and sufficient.
Deadline: Date of the viva. And the viva will held after the final. You will be notified about the date later.
NO PLAGIARISM WILL BE TOLERATED. In the viva, you will be asked to explain your solution.

For the answer: view the doc file. 
The doc contains the code, output format required by the course instructor and the input file as well. 
You just need to manipulate it on your own. 
note: This is not the final version although I got 10 out of 10, the code may require refactoring.
